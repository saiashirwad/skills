description: Plan work too big for one session as a map of decision tickets on GitHub issues, resolving one ticket per session until the way to the destination is clear.
disable-model-invocation: true
---

- Use wayfinder when a loose idea is too big for one session and the way to its destination is not visible yet
- Wayfinder plans; it does not build
  - When you feel the pull to do the work, you are at the edge of the map; hand off
  - A map's Notes can override these rules
- Scripts are in `~/.agents/skills/wayfinder/scripts/`; run them in the repo
- In anything the user reads, refer to an issue by its linked title, never by bare number
- A map is a GitHub issue labelled `wayfinder:map`; its tickets are sub-issues
  - The map is an index: each decision lives only in its ticket
  - Do not list open tickets on the map; `show` queries them
- Map body:

  ```markdown
  ## Destination
  <what done looks like: a spec, a locked decision, or a change. One or two lines.>

  ## Notes
  <domain; skills every session should use; standing preferences>

  ## Decisions so far
  - [<closed ticket title>](url): <one-line gist>

  ## Not yet specified
  <fog: in-scope questions not yet sharp enough to ticket>

  ## Out of scope
  - [<closed ticket title>](url): <gist, and why it is out>
  ```

- A ticket is a question whose answer is a decision, sized to one session
  - Body: `## Question`, then what the question needs
  - `research` (AFK): facts from outside the repo; delegate a Research job
  - `prototype` (HITL): a cheap artifact to react to, when the question is how something should look or behave
    - Delegate the build as a Prototype job; then settle it with the user
  - `grilling` (HITL, the default): a conversation with `grilling` and `domain-modeling`
    - Never answer the user's side yourself
  - `task` (AFK): work that must happen before a decision (sign up, provision, move data)
    - Delegate what an agent can do alone as a Chore job; give the user a checklist for the rest
- A ticket is on the frontier when it is open, unblocked and unassigned
- Ticket a question when you can state it sharply now, even if it is blocked
  - Otherwise keep it in Not yet specified
- Work past the destination is out of scope
  - Resolve its ticket with `--out-of-scope`; it never returns to this map
- Delegate AFK tickets with the `delegate` skill
  - Research uses `--rift research/<slug>`; Pi commits `docs/research/<slug>.md` and pushes the branch
  - Pi does not touch the ticket or the map; when the job is done, inspect the work and run `resolve`
  - Outside Herdr: leave AFK tickets open; tell the user which ones wait for a Herdr session
- Chart a map (the user brings an idea)
  - Pin the destination with `grilling` and `domain-modeling`
  - Grill breadth-first for the open decisions
    - If there is no fog, you do not need a map; ask the user how to continue
  - Run `map`; write Notes and fog with `gh issue edit <map> --body-file -`
  - Run `ticket` for each question you can state; then run `block` in a second pass
  - Delegate every research ticket, then stop; charting resolves nothing
- Work a map (the user brings a map)
  - Run `show <map>`; read the map body, not every ticket
  - Take the named ticket, or the first HITL ticket on the frontier; `claim` it before any work
  - Delegate the AFK tickets on the frontier; they can run in parallel
  - Resolve the ticket; zoom into related tickets as needed and use the skills Notes names
  - Run `resolve` with the answer and a one-line gist
  - Ticket and `block` questions that are now sharp; clear the fog they came from
  - Resolve tickets that are now out of scope; fix tickets the decision invalidated
  - Resolve one HITL ticket per session
  - Other sessions can edit the map at the same time
- Scripts
  - `map <title> <destination>` creates a map with empty sections
  - `ticket <map> <type> <title> < body` creates and labels a ticket and adds it to the map
  - `block <ticket> <blocker...>` marks the ticket as blocked by each blocker
  - `show <map>` prints the map body and the open tickets, grouped as frontier, blocked and claimed
  - `claim <ticket>` assigns the ticket to you; it fails if someone else has it
  - `resolve <ticket> <gist> [--out-of-scope] < answer` comments the answer, closes the ticket and adds the gist line to Decisions so far or Out of scope
