# Interface Craft

**By Josh Puckett**

A toolkit for building polished, animated interfaces. Write animations you can read like a script, then tune them with live controls.

---

## Skills

| Skill | When to Use | Invoke |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Storyboard Animation](storyboard-animation.md) | Writing or refactoring multi-stage animations into a human-readable DSL | `/interface-craft storyboard` or describe an animation |
| [DialKit 2.0](dialkit.md) | Adding live panels, XY pads, image/color controls, transition editors, or application-driven value updates | `/interface-craft dialkit` or mention DialKit/controls/tuning |
| [DialKit Timeline](dialkit-timeline.md) | Tuning choreography, sequences, property tracks, loops, or reversible state changes with a scrubbable timeline | Mention timeline/clips/markers/scrubbing |
| [Design Critique](design-critique.md) | Systematic UI critique of a screenshot, component, or page | `/interface-craft critique` or paste a screenshot for review |

## Quick Start

### Storyboard Animation

Turn any animation into a readable storyboard with named timing, config objects, and stage-driven sequencing:

```tsx
/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ANIMATION STORYBOARD
 *
 *    0ms   waiting for scroll into view
 *  300ms   card fades in, scale 0.85 → 1.0
 *  900ms   heading highlights
 * 1500ms   rows slide up (staggered 200ms)
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */

const TIMING = {
  cardAppear:  300,   // card fades in
  heading:     900,   // heading highlights
  rows:        1500,  // rows start staggering
};
```

See [storyboard-animation.md](storyboard-animation.md) for the full pattern spec.

### DialKit

Generate live control panels for tuning values in real time. For example, in React:

```tsx
const params = useDialKit('Card', {
  scale: [1, 0.5, 2],
  blur: [0, 0, 100],
  position: { type: 'pad' },
  spring: { type: 'spring', visualDuration: 0.3, bounce: 0.2 },
})
```

See [dialkit.md](dialkit.md) for setup, all control types, controllers, presets, and framework adapters. Transition controls return a spring/easing union; follow its Motion conversion guidance when applying them.

The DialKit guidance targets **2.0.0**. For clip timing, sequences, property tracks, loops, replayable animations, timeline markers/events, or scrubbing, read and follow [dialkit-timeline.md](dialkit-timeline.md). Panels and timelines use separate authoring surfaces and can be used together.

## Sub-Skill Routing

When the user invokes `/interface-craft`:

1. **With `timeline`, clips, markers, timeline events, playhead, scrubbing, sequence-timing, intro-then-loop, or replayable-animation context** → Load and follow [dialkit-timeline.md](dialkit-timeline.md)
2. **With `dialkit`, dials, sliders, XY pads, image/color controls, Bézier editing, presets, controllers, tune, or tweak context** → Load and follow [dialkit.md](dialkit.md)
3. **With `storyboard` or general animation-choreography context** → Load and follow [storyboard-animation.md](storyboard-animation.md)
4. **With `critique`, a pasted image, or review-related context** → Load and follow [design-critique.md](design-critique.md)
5. **With a file path** → Read the file, detect whether it needs storyboard refactoring, DialKit panels, a DialKit timeline, or a design critique, and apply the appropriate skill
6. **With a plain-English description of an animation** → Use storyboard-animation unless the request emphasizes live timing, clips, or scrubbing
7. **Ambiguous** → Ask which skill to use

## Design Principles

1. **Readable over clever** — Anyone should be able to scan the top of a file and understand the animation sequence without reading implementation code
2. **Tunable by default** — Every value that affects timing or appearance should be a named constant, trivially adjustable
3. **Data-driven** — Repeated elements use arrays and `.map()`, not copy-pasted blocks
4. **Explicit sequencing** — Storyboards use stage state; DialKit timelines derive animated values and reversible marker state from the playhead
5. **Spring-first** — Prefer spring physics over duration-based easing for natural motion
6. **Authoring-aware** — Use DialKit's scrubbable timeline preview while tuning, then translate the tuned choreography to the app's real animation system when explicitly finalizing for production
